# Boo Bash

## Intro

You and your friends are having a spooky party...but no one brought pumpkins! Other ghosts are having the same problem, but pumpkins are limited! Be the first team to bring 10 pumpkins back to your graveyard, but be wary! All ghosts can shoot deadly fireballs, and lugging pumpkins around will slow you down and keep your fire ball hands full!

## How to Play

Used the WASD keys or IJKL keys to move your ghost around. Aim and shooting is done with the mouse movement and the mouse left click. To score, grab the pumpkin in the middle of the map with spacebar and bring it back to your spawn point. First team to score 10 points wins the game.
